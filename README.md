# appdensitycalculation
The general formula to get the population density is the number of people divided by the land area. In this case, we used “Population” divided by “brgyarea”. We used merge, aggregate, function division, and sorting to arrive with our barangay density results.
In this case,  we used a similar approach to the barangay density problem but we considered the interaction between the data between the barangay and the city levels through the use of the duplicate function (to prevent the double input of value when computing). Carrying over the new data from the barangay level, we were able to arrive at our city density results.

In this exercise, we assume that the area for each barangay and city is equal for each region given. 

Formula 1: Area of Region / Number of Brgys(or Cities) in Region

Formula 2: Population / Brgy(and/or City) Area

Final Step: Rank the top 5 most densely populated areas.
